How is this LWP library different from a real thread management library? 
    - Our method of handling parameters is not as robust as a library would be.
    - We have a limitation of the number of thread ids available.
    - We don't support all registers availble on x86-64
    - There are no checks for a stack overflow for each thread.


Name 2 ways in which this LWP library API could be improved.
    - Adding a signal handler to support preempting threads.
    - Handling more than 6 parameters by pushing onto thread's stack.
